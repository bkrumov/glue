### Proposals / Orders / Positions

This domain consists of 9 Tables which give the user the opportunity to model portfolio changes and the associated transactions. 

An Investment Proposition is created when a client advisor wants to: modify an existing client's portfolio, suggest new opportunities, simulate trades and investigate the impact upon client holdings. Glue facilitates creation of a simulated portfolio with the changes. So that the advisor can easily asses the risk and the compliance with the predetermined investment strategy.

Once the investment proposition is approved, it generates an order in the related trading system.
